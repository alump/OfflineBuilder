OfflineBuilder
==============

Idea of project is create addon that would be allow construction of offline UI for TouchKit applications
on server side. Initial goal would be to allow to write very simple UIs. And then adding more features
when core Vaadin framework allows to do so.

Current State
-------------

Code is not working yet. It will be written as my side project now and then. There are no estimates when
(or if) it will be finished.

License Notice
--------------

This addon code is licensed in Apache2, but it has touchkit dependency. TouchKit has CVAL and AGPL license
options. Apache2 conflicts with AGPL, so only way to use this is to have CVAL license of TouchKit. This
license thing will be cleared when project is at level that it can be used in actual projects. But anyway
the code of this project, as it is, can be used as Apache2 license allows to use it.
